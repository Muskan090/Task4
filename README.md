# Task4
I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully built and evaluated multiple sales prediction models based on an advertising dataset.

In this project, I explored the relationship between advertising variables (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and sales, and leveraged machine learning techniques to develop accurate predictive models.

After careful analysis, I compared the performance of three different regression models: Linear Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
